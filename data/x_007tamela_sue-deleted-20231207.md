Not sure even toddlers could make it. One year olds can’t even walk typically. Even large birds would predate on them. Tropical place maybe but there they have monsoons & killer bugs/snakes. <!--1104557646991052801-->

Highly unlikely unless a bunch of chimps take some in. They just don’t have survival skills at 1. Drown in water. <!--1104548171215265793-->
